# Client Side Browser Generator for Storage Boxes

This is mostly based on previous work by various people (see links below)<br>
it is an abominable mix of code, but it hopefully works <br>

The Source of the OpenSCAD 3D-model is managed in a separate [repo](https://github.com/9R/Customizable-OpenSCAD-Storage-Box).

## Future improvements:
- Parse Input values from openscad file
- Refactor code so it isn't a nightmare
- Allow saving state in browser
- Improve user input validation
- Improve 3D view, button to reset view to start and correct zoom etc.

All credit goes to their respective owners, all mistakes and fuckups are mine. <br>
