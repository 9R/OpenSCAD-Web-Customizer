# Client Side Browser Generator for Gridfinity
Live here (probably):

This was made just for fun over a weekend, as an exercise in web dev <br>
it is an abominable mix of code, but it hopefully works <br>

Derived from https://github.com/vector76/Web_OpenSCAD_Customizer, and modified poorly to try and have an improved UX

All credit goes to their respective owners, all mistakes and fuckups are mine. <br>
